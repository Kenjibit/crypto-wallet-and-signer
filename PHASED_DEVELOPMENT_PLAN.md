# Phased Development Plan - BTC Unsigned Testnet

## Overview

This plan breaks down the development into three distinct phases to enable incremental validation and easier debugging. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for early testing and issue identification.

## Phase 1: Base Complete

**Goal**: Establish foundational infrastructure and basic functionality

### What We'll Build

- [ ] Monorepo structure and configuration
- [ ] Package.json dependencies and build scripts
- [ ] Next.js configuration for all apps
- [ ] Basic PWA setup and service workers
- [ ] TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Basic routing and layout structure

### What We'll Validate

- [ ] All packages build successfully
- [ ] Apps start and run without errors
- [ ] Basic PWA features work (offline, install prompt)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] No dependency conflicts

### Success Criteria

- Clean builds from both monorepo root and individual packages
- Apps accessible via browser with basic functionality
- PWA manifest and service worker working
- No console errors or build warnings

## Phase 2: Utilities Complete

**Goal**: Implement all core utility functions and business logic

### What We'll Build

- [ ] Bitcoin transaction utilities
  - [ ] PSBT generation and manipulation
  - [ ] Fee estimation algorithms
  - [ ] UTXO selection strategies
  - [ ] Transaction creation helpers
- [ ] Cryptographic utilities
  - [ ] Entropy generation and mixing
  - [ ] Key derivation functions
  - [ ] BIP32/BIP39 implementations
- [ ] QR code utilities
  - [ ] Generation for PSBTs
  - [ ] Scanning and parsing
- [ ] Data encoding/decoding utilities

### What We'll Validate

- [ ] Each utility function works independently
- [ ] Unit tests pass for all utilities
- [ ] Integration between utilities works correctly
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

### Success Criteria

- All utility functions have passing tests
- Functions can be imported and used correctly
- Error cases are handled gracefully
- No memory leaks or performance issues

## Phase 3: Components Complete

**Goal**: Build complete user interface and user experience flows

### What We'll Build

- [ ] Transaction management components
  - [ ] Transaction creation forms
  - [ ] PSBT display and editing
  - [ ] Fee selection interfaces
  - [ ] Broadcast confirmation modals
- [ ] Wallet management components
  - [ ] Wallet creation flows
  - [ ] Import/export functionality
  - [ ] Security setup (passkeys, etc.)
- [ ] QR code components
  - [ ] Scanner with camera access
  - [ ] Display components
  - [ ] Copy/paste functionality
- [ ] Navigation and layout components
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

### What We'll Validate

- [ ] All user flows work end-to-end
- [ ] Components integrate correctly
- [ ] UI is responsive and accessible
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance is smooth on target devices

### Success Criteria

- Complete user journey from wallet creation to transaction broadcast
- All components render correctly
- User interactions work as expected
- App is production-ready

## Development Workflow

### Between Phases

1. **Complete Phase**: Finish all items in current phase
2. **Validate Phase**: Test all success criteria thoroughly
3. **Fix Issues**: Resolve any problems found during validation
4. **Document**: Update documentation and notes
5. **Move to Next Phase**: Only proceed when current phase is 100% complete

### During Each Phase

- Focus only on the current phase goals
- Don't start work on future phases
- If you discover issues that affect future phases, note them but don't fix them yet
- Keep a running list of "things to fix in next phase"

### Testing Strategy

- **Phase 1**: Manual testing of builds and basic functionality
- **Phase 2**: Unit tests + integration tests for utilities
- **Phase 3**: End-to-end testing + user acceptance testing

---

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Early Validation**: Catch infrastructure issues before building complex features
2. **Isolated Testing**: Test utilities independently from UI components
3. **Incremental Progress**: See working functionality at each stage
4. **Easier Debugging**: Know exactly which phase introduced issues
5. **Better Quality**: Each phase builds on a solid foundation
6. **User Feedback**: Can get early feedback on core functionality

---

## Risk Mitigation

- **Phase 1 Risks**: Build configuration issues, dependency conflicts
- **Phase 2 Risks**: Complex crypto logic bugs, performance issues
- **Phase 3 Risks**: UI integration problems, user experience issues

Each phase addresses the risks of the previous phase and sets up success for the next.

---

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 days (infrastructure setup)
- **Phase 2**: 3-5 days (utility development and testing)
- **Phase 3**: 4-7 days (component development and integration)

**Total**: 8-14 days depending on complexity and testing requirements

---

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Begin Phase 1: Base Complete
3. Work through each phase systematically
4. Validate thoroughly before moving to next phase

This phased approach ensures we build a solid foundation and catch issues early, leading to a more robust and maintainable application.
