# Authentication Flow Validation Checklist

## ✅ Core Authentication Tests

### Passkey Authentication
- [ ] **Passkey Creation Flow**
  - [ ] User clicks action → Auth setup modal appears
  - [ ] User selects passkey → Biometric prompt appears immediately
  - [ ] User completes biometrics → Passkey created successfully
  - [ ] Auth state updates to `{method: 'passkey', status: 'authenticated', credentialId: 'xxx'}`
  - [ ] User sees "Authentication Setup Complete!" screen
  - [ ] User clicks "Continue to Wallet" → Goes directly to intended action
  - [ ] **NO** second authentication prompt

- [ ] **Passkey Verification Flow**
  - [ ] Existing user clicks action → Auth verification modal appears
  - [ ] User completes biometrics → Authentication succeeds
  - [ ] Goes directly to intended action

### PIN Authentication
- [ ] **PIN Creation Flow**
  - [ ] User selects PIN → PIN setup screen appears
  - [ ] User enters 4-digit PIN → Validation works
  - [ ] User confirms PIN → PIN saved successfully
  - [ ] Auth state updates to `{method: 'pin', status: 'authenticated'}`
  - [ ] User proceeds to action without additional prompts

- [ ] **PIN Verification Flow**
  - [ ] Existing user enters PIN → Authentication succeeds
  - [ ] Goes directly to intended action

## ✅ State Management Tests

### Auth State Consistency
- [ ] **State Persistence**
  - [ ] Auth state saved to localStorage on creation
  - [ ] Auth state restored on page reload
  - [ ] Credential ID persists correctly

- [ ] **State Validation**
  - [ ] No conflicting auth states (authenticated but no method)
  - [ ] Passkey method always has credentialId
  - [ ] PIN method doesn't have credentialId
  - [ ] State validation functions catch inconsistencies

- [ ] **State Transitions**
  - [x] unauthenticated → authenticating → authenticated (success)
  - [x] unauthenticated → authenticating → failed (error)
  - [x] authenticated → unauthenticated (logout)
  - [x] State synchronization between components (FIXED: Added polling mechanism)

## ✅ Error Handling Tests

### User Cancellation
- [ ] **Passkey Cancellation**
  - [ ] User cancels biometric prompt → Returns to setup screen
  - [ ] Error message displayed appropriately
  - [ ] Can retry or switch to PIN

- [ ] **PIN Validation Errors**
  - [ ] Non-numeric PIN → Error displayed
  - [ ] PIN too short/long → Error displayed
  - [ ] PIN mismatch → Error displayed

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] **Unsupported Browsers**
  - [ ] Passkey not supported → Only PIN option shown
  - [ ] Graceful fallback to PIN authentication

- [ ] **PWA Detection**
  - [ ] Correctly detects PWA vs browser
  - [ ] Appropriate authentication options shown

### Network/System Errors
- [ ] **WebAuthn Failures**
  - [ ] Network errors during passkey creation
  - [ ] Device compatibility issues
  - [ ] Corrupted credential data

## ✅ Security Tests

### Credential Validation
- [ ] **Credential Integrity**
  - [ ] Credential ID format validation (base64)
  - [ ] Credential ID uniqueness
  - [ ] No credential ID collisions

- [ ] **Authentication Bypass Prevention**
  - [ ] Cannot access protected actions without auth
  - [ ] Auth state cannot be manipulated externally
  - [ ] Session timeout handled properly

### Data Protection
- [ ] **Sensitive Data Handling**
  - [ ] PIN codes not logged in console
  - [ ] Credential data properly encoded
  - [ ] No sensitive data in localStorage

## ✅ Integration Tests

### Full User Flows
- [ ] **New User Journey**
  1. First app visit → No auth setup
  2. Click action → Auth setup required
  3. Choose passkey → Biometric setup
  4. Complete setup → Direct action execution
  5. Subsequent visits → Auto-authenticated

- [ ] **Returning User Journey**
  1. App visit with existing auth → Auto-restored
  2. Click action → Verification required
  3. Complete verification → Direct action execution

### Cross-Component Integration
- [ ] **Main Page ↔ Auth Modals**
  - [ ] State synchronization works
  - [ ] Modal lifecycle correct
  - [ ] Pending actions execute properly

- [ ] **Auth Context ↔ Components**
  - [ ] All components receive updated auth state
  - [ ] No stale state issues
  - [ ] Event propagation works

## ✅ Performance Tests

### Response Times
- [ ] **Auth Setup Performance**
  - [ ] Modal appears instantly on action click
  - [ ] Biometric prompt appears quickly
  - [ ] State updates propagate immediately

- [ ] **Memory Usage**
  - [ ] No memory leaks from auth listeners
  - [ ] Proper cleanup on component unmount

## ✅ Edge Cases

### Rapid Actions
- [ ] **Multiple Quick Clicks**
  - [ ] Double-clicking action button doesn't break flow
  - [ ] Concurrent auth requests handled properly

### State Race Conditions
- [ ] **React State Updates**
  - [ ] No race conditions between auth state updates
  - [ ] Pending actions execute with correct state
  - [ ] Component re-renders don't cause issues

### Browser Edge Cases
- [ ] **Page Reload During Auth**
  - [ ] Auth process can be resumed
  - [ ] No corrupted state after reload

- [ ] **Tab Switching**
  - [ ] Auth state maintained across tabs
  - [ ] No interference between multiple tabs

## ✅ Console Log Validation

### Expected Log Flow (Passkey)
```
🎯 Create Wallet button clicked
🚪 requireAuth called
🚪 authState.status: unauthenticated
🚪 User is unauthenticated, showing auth setup
📱 AuthSetupModal: Starting passkey setup
🔐 Starting passkey creation...
🔐 Passkey creation completed
🔒 Auth state validation complete: PASSED
🔐 Auth state update called, returning true
📱 AuthSetupModal: Auth state is now authenticated in modal!
📱 AuthSetupModal: Moving to confirm step
📱 AuthSetupModal: handleComplete called
✅ handleAuthSetupComplete called
✅ Current authState: {method: 'passkey', status: 'authenticated'}
✅ Auth state validated, proceeding with action
🎯 Pending action: Setting current mode to create
🎯 Current mode set to create
```

### Red Flags to Watch For
- ❌ Auth state resets to unauthenticated after creation
- ❌ Multiple authentication prompts
- ❌ Validation errors in console
- ❌ Inconsistent state between components
- ❌ Infinite useEffect loops
