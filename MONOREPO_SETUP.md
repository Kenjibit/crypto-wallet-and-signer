## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Setup

- [x] Created monorepo structure with npm workspaces
- [x] Set up root package.json and tsconfig.json
- [x] Configured Next.js transpilePackages for shared dependencies

### ✅ Phase 2: UI Component Extraction

- [x] Moved shared UI components to `packages/ui`
- [x] Created proper TypeScript configurations
- [x] Implemented CSS module type declarations
- [x] Verified component exports and imports

### ✅ Phase 3: Application Separation

- [x] Moved `btc-unsigned` application to `packages/btc-unsigned/src/app`
- [x] Moved `btc-signer` application to `packages/btc-signer/src/app`
- [x] Updated all import paths to use `@btc-wallet/ui`
- [x] Verified both applications build successfully

### ✅ Phase 4: Testing & Cleanup

- [x] Tested builds for each package
- [x] Verified tree-shaking works correctly
- [x] Removed duplicate files (app/, src/, lib/, types/, .next/)
- [x] Updated documentation

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build:all

# Build individual packages
npm run --workspace=@btc-wallet/ui build
npm run --workspace=btc-unsigned build
npm run --workspace=btc-signer build

# Development servers
npm run dev:unsigned
npm run dev:signer
```

## Package Dependencies

- **@btc-wallet/ui**: Shared UI components and styles
- **btc-unsigned**: Main application with API routes
- **btc-signer**: Transaction signing application

## Testing Results

All packages build successfully with:

- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Next.js builds
- ✅ Shared component imports
- ✅ CSS module support
- ✅ Proper tree-shaking

## Notes

- ESLint warnings about unused variables (non-blocking)
- WebAssembly async/await warnings (expected for tiny-secp256k1)
- All critical functionality working correctly

The monorepo is now fully functional and ready for development!
